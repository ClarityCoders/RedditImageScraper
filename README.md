## Run download script!
- Add any subs you want to download to the sub_list.csv one per line.
- Run SubDownload.py
- The first time you run the script it will ask you for details. Note you don't need to enter a user name or password if you don't plan on posting.
- The script will create a token.pickle file so you don't have to enter them again. If you mess up your credentials just delete the pickle file and it will ask for them again.
- The script will create an images folder and fill it with images it finds. You can change how many posts it checks on each subreddit by changing POST_SEARCH_AMOUNT. Also not note every post is a image post so if you put in 5 it may only find 2 images.
